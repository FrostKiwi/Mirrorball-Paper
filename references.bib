  abstract  = {We demonstrate a novel light probe which can estimate the full dynamic range of a scene with multiple bright light sources. It places diffuse strips between mirrored spherical quadrants, effectively co-locating diffuse and mirrored probes to record the full dynamic range of illumination in a single exposure. From this image, we estimate the intensity of multiple saturated light sources by solving a linear system.},
